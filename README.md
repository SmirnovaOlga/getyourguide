## General

* Based on React + Webpack.
* I've organized code in a way I'll do it in larger code base. That's certainly an overkill for such a small application, just wanted to demonstrate the approach.

## How to start locally

* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`
* Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
